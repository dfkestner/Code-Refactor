# Horiseon Optimal Online Experience
The goal was to increase the accessibility, functionality, and efficiency of the codebase for the Horiseon webpage while maintaining its original design.

Non-semantic HTML elements were replaced with more descriptive tags, and descriptive alt attributes were added to featured images. Comments were added to CSS, and the code was consolidated and simplified.

The use of semantic tags reduced the need for class and id tags, which made it easier to style and format the content. There are images referenced in the style sheet and the index file, so any changes to the filepath for the images will need to be updated in both CSS and HTML.
